DS 440,2019-04-28 21:53:08,Yuya,"We've still got time and I need to write out two new sections now, which should be quick for me",0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:52:32,Yuya,and maybe phrase it as a suggestion for additional interpretation methods - sort of fulfilling the advice to NASA type writing,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:52:08,Yuya,Yeah that works and also anchors,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:52:00,Tomoki Takasawa,"I can briefly write about LIME and put that there as ""Alternative Approach"" or soemthing like that under analysis",0

DS 440,2019-04-28 21:50:59,Tomoki Takasawa,Do you think we should?,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:50:54,Tomoki Takasawa,"Should I include that too? I thought since we do not have a visuals for them, we would not put it there. That's why we did not put it in the mid-report either?",0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:48:49,Yuya,We didnt include LIME analysis yet?,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:47:46,Yuya,Perfect,0

DS 440,2019-04-28 21:27:10,Yuya,Just comb through those quotation marks and basically retype them and it should fix the problem,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 21:26:16,Yuya,Also I just noticed some of the quotation Mark's are not rendered properly in ur section ,0

DS 440,2019-04-28 20:57:37,Yuya,This can avoid the whole latex breaking when the figures change ,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 20:57:07,Yuya,If not then it's not a big deal. It just helps us to submit it fastsr,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 20:56:46,Yuya,I would appreciate it alot if u might have a bit of time to fix it,1

DS 440,2019-04-28 20:54:28,Yuya,Yo dude you got a bit of time?,1
DS 440,2019-04-28 20:52:49,Yuya,We are almost done phase 2 is closed to finis,0

DS 440,2019-04-28 19:30:21,Tomoki Takasawa,Thanks for all the work. Sorry I cannot help at the moment,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 19:30:05,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok.. I am still focused on the study for CMPSC448 final. but I will try making time sometimes tonight.,0
DS 440,2019-04-28 16:53:57,Yuya,Update: I finished Phase 1 portion - we're down to the second phase,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:41:40,Yuya,so its one or the other,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:41:35,Yuya,while on other times he will be uber harsh,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:41:28,Yuya,Sometimes hes really easy and gives pretty high grades,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:41:12,Yuya,Well it actually depends,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:40:52,Tomoki Takasawa,🤞,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:40:42,Tomoki Takasawa,He seems to be a harsh grader.,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:40:32,Tomoki Takasawa,Yup ,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:16:17,Yuya,(But I guess thats for dr yen to judge lolol),0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:16:01,Yuya,I think we did a pretty good job overall,1

DS 440,2019-04-27 23:12:16,Yuya,for example in the feature importance i added a correlation matix,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:11:51,Yuya,esp being more explicit with definitions and metrics,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:11:37,Yuya,But I have to add more things in phase 1,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:11:15,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:11:07,Yuya,I'm just proof reading over phase 1 work,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:11:03,Tomoki Takasawa,"So it might be better practice if you start 2(?) so, if you left out some for tomorrow morning, I have better chance being able to fill out.. ",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:10:50,Yuya,I'll see what I can do,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:10:24,Tomoki Takasawa,"If you left out any, I might not be able to finish up phase 2, as I was more engaged in the analysis for phase 1 while you were working on phase 2",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 23:00:42,Yuya,We're basically on the same boat in terms of the number of work,1
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:59:10,Yuya,"Anyways, I'll have to charge chug away at the problem and see how far I get",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:58:29,Yuya,Section 1 I am currently working on - but section 2 is basically pretty empty actually,0

DS 440,2019-04-27 22:58:05,Tomoki Takasawa,I can probably fill in some part of section 1 if necessary,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:58:02,Yuya,You did quite alot for the analysis and I really appreciate that,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:52,Yuya,Nah dont worry man,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:44,Tomoki Takasawa,ok,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:43,Tomoki Takasawa,I feel bad. but I really need to study for CMPSC 448..,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:34,Yuya,portions*,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:28,Yuya,I mean at this point I'm going over each section and filling in any gaps and working on the project,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:22,Tomoki Takasawa,I will allocate like an hour in the morning..,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:11,Yuya,Ah okay,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:02,Tomoki Takasawa,Maybe tomorrow morning,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:57:02,Yuya,Ah alright then,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:56,Tomoki Takasawa,"Ahh, not today any more..",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:39,Yuya,Because if you can I was wondering if you can help me with some of the other sections,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:37,Tomoki Takasawa,I think it might be useful if you want to do that.,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:24,Yuya,jw,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:23,Yuya,So how much time do you have for the paper,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:11,Tomoki Takasawa,Oh cool,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:06,Yuya,I saw that,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:56:01,Tomoki Takasawa,"I made function called getFalsePositiveData(yColName, isFiltered)",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:54:20,Yuya,using the mean of the SHAP,0

DS 440,2019-04-27 22:53:53,Yuya,actually i might take the analysis a bit further and compare the discrepancies of the FO,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:53:45,Tomoki Takasawa,"Also, the code at the bottom is for classfying the FP events to each class",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:53:20,Yuya,Okay,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:53:19,Tomoki Takasawa,I have dependency plot for each of the features on notebook. but I did not really see anything particularly interesting enough to mention it on paper.,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 22:51:38,Tomoki Takasawa,I just wrote bunch of stuff based on the summary plot for the phase 2 around how our model predicts PC and non-PC,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:54:51,Yuya,I'll fill in gaps if necessary then,1
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:54:42,Yuya,Okay,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:54:09,Tomoki Takasawa,I am looking at some of the features and doing some analysis on how they affect the result,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:54:06,Yuya,"Alright, I'll see what I can do then",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:53:29,Tomoki Takasawa,Ummm. I do not think I can cover that by Sun... I have not started on prepping for final yet....,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:48:34,Yuya,But its also good to look at the discrepancies,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:48:16,Yuya,Yeah that too,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:46:54,Tomoki Takasawa,I thought this was for the PC vs non-PC?,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:46:36,Tomoki Takasawa,This question?,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:46:30,Tomoki Takasawa,"Does the Robovetter completeness significantly vary with signal-to-noise ratio, period,
or other parameters?",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:36:23,Yuya,because for example between ETL and EM I notice that the relative ranks of impact is slightly different,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:35:31,Yuya,I think that would help to answer the second question as well,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:35:01,Yuya,so that we can visually compare the impact that each feature has on the type of false positive,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:33:57,Yuya,is there a way we can essentially compare the discrepancies between the different false positives of the shap values?,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:33:34,Yuya,I was wondering...,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:57,Yuya,nice,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:48,Tomoki Takasawa,Just finished the correction that we got from Ford,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:47,Yuya,out of context it was weird tho,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:39,Yuya,after i saw the notebook it made much more sense what you were trying to do,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:26,Tomoki Takasawa,That resulted in 85%,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:26,Yuya,yeah I saw that,1
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:32:17,Tomoki Takasawa,I did that too,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:21:59,Yuya,i thought you were computing true positives based on the ground truth,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:21:44,Yuya,now it makes sense,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:21:41,Tomoki Takasawa,for any given data,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:21:41,Yuya,oooh okay,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:21:34,Tomoki Takasawa,"yeah, it counts the proportion of 1",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:19:33,Yuya,"Oh okay, so in other words you are seeing the overall ratio at how much 1s are essentially being predicted",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:18:43,Tomoki Takasawa,"So, if you inject the ground truth as parameter, it will count it for the groun truth. If you have predicted y in parameter, it will count it for the predicted one",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:17:58,Tomoki Takasawa,count function literally takes in the data and count number of 1s.,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:17:19,Yuya,"So in this count, you are not counting it based on some ground truth?",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:17:01,Yuya,Whats weird is the way you are counting the data tho... im not following that,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:05:06,Tomoki Takasawa,"Just run before the cell that says ""# From here, each classes""",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:04:39,Yuya,I see,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:04:06,Tomoki Takasawa,"So, I just calculated that to answer this question. Both from ground truth (raw data), and our catboost",0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:03:25,Tomoki Takasawa,One of the question was  how often does the Robovetter classify an injected planet as a planet candidate,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:02:05,Yuya,Im not sure whether I'm following your analysis though...,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:01:54,Yuya,https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:01:52,Yuya,cant u just use the sklearn packages for the metrics though for that...?,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:00:17,Yuya,thanks,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 21:00:14,Tomoki Takasawa,Yes,0

DS 440,2019-04-27 20:59:29,Yuya,Hmm,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 20:59:03,Yuya,also the annoying thing i realized is that we need to be sort of pedantic in this paper cuz dr ford doesnt seem to get alot of the ML terminology,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 20:59:02,Tomoki Takasawa,What I did is to predict the y based on the CatBoost and calculated the proportion of the PC from the result,0
DS 440,2019-04-27 20:58:09,Yuya,Its a ratio relative to the sample space of the positive examples,0

DS 440,2019-04-19 16:34:14,Yuya,Yeah like a sub intro,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 16:34:01,Tomoki Takasawa,"So, as far as the structure goes, are you ok with having two (or three) intrdocuction for each part?",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 16:33:57,Yuya,"Cool, keep me posted on progress - will do the same here as I build my models",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 16:33:22,Tomoki Takasawa,I went home. I am working now,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:56:48,Yuya,I've already started to plot out the plans for the modeling im gonna be doing,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:56:36,Yuya,"As long as you can structure the paper, I'm good on my end",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:56:22,Yuya,Which ever works for you,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:55:13,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok I’m done with my appointment. But will you need me to be in library? Otherwise I’ll work from home?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:01:18,Yuya,HAHA,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:01:12,Tomoki Takasawa,I didn’t wanna walk to the bus stop. Lmao,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:00:49,Yuya,Or could have taken the blue loop,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:00:38,Yuya,Its raining,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:00:36,Yuya,I would have done the same tbh,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 15:00:24,Tomoki Takasawa,I ended up taking Uber to health center. Cannot believe how lazy I am,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:19:44,Yuya,"Cool, I'll pull up a chair so that you can work here with me",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:19:28,Tomoki Takasawa,I’m on my way there. ,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:19:15,Yuya,How about we do this:,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:18:13,Yuya,I have a trial account that I can use for about 1~2 weeks which is just right,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:17:41,Yuya,Basically making use of industrial tools,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:17:34,Yuya,"Just chuck the data and it generated hundreds of models + automated feature engineering, cross-validation, etc",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:17:15,Yuya,"I just got access to H2O.ai, which is an automated ML modeling pipeline",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:17:00,Yuya,Also,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:15:35,Yuya,and it appears Autovetter is getting around high 96% accuracy beacause of the abundant features they are using,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:14:56,Yuya,Gotcah,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:14:45,Tomoki Takasawa,just checking,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:14:40,Tomoki Takasawa,ok.,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:14:32,Yuya,I mean we will be including all of our models,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:13:23,Tomoki Takasawa,"For the final report, do you want to include some of the models other than Catboost?",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:12:33,Tomoki Takasawa,"Yeah, I see it now",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:10:56,Yuya,The link to the exoplanet archive,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:10:49,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:10:05,Tomoki Takasawa,Is that where you found the data set?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:09:57,Tomoki Takasawa,i see.,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:08:17,Yuya,Its probably a GIF,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:08:10,Yuya,I actually searched on google for autovetter and found a link to the Google Research github,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:08:08,Tomoki Takasawa,"I always wanted to put video on the README, never figured out. lol",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:07:47,Tomoki Takasawa,I am seeing that now.,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:07:40,Tomoki Takasawa,"Wait, where does the github repo come from?",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:07:05,Yuya,I'll plan it out a bit and see what we can do,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:06:10,Yuya,,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:06:06,Yuya,Their autovetter dataset is available from the catalog,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:05:10,Yuya,Its worth a try,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:04:53,Yuya,I found the source for where we can get data on that: https://github.com/google-research/exoplanet-ml/blob/master/exoplanet-ml/astronet/README.md,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:04:32,Yuya,"Since robovetter is based on a heuristic based approach while astronet is more of a ml based approach, we can use it as sort of a ensemble approach",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:03:57,Tomoki Takasawa,What is it ,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:03:57,Yuya,What if we combined the data from both the robovetter data and the astronet?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:03:38,Yuya,I just thought of an interesting idea,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:02:24,Yuya,Basically its solving the same exact problem as we are,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:02:17,Tomoki Takasawa,ok,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:02:10,Yuya,Since thats probably the closest and most relevant one,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:01:59,Yuya,Id say read the second one first,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:01:54,Yuya,Yeah that was from the second paper,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:01:43,Tomoki Takasawa,Did you find it on the second paper?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:01:35,Tomoki Takasawa,I’m trying to read the first one still ,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 14:01:22,Tomoki Takasawa,Yeah. I see it.,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:59:39,Yuya,"Yo this is key:
""The autovetter and robovetter evolved in parallel, learning from each other iteratively.
The process has benefitted both, improving their respective planet catalogs. For example,
early robovetter results indicated that the autovetter was initially misclassifying some
TCEs with secondary eclipses as planet candidates; by adding new attributes we improved the autovetter’s ability to correctly classify secondary eclipses. In the other
direction, autovetter results showed that the robovetter was too strongly rejecting
candidates based on diagnostics indicating a possible centroid offset, which allowed the
robovetter to be tuned to mitigate that problem.",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:56:42,Yuya,Ah yeah that CM was on training set,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:56:22,Yuya,yeah lol,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:56:18,Tomoki Takasawa,"That’s what confused me. Ok, just checking ",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:56:16,Yuya,You can compute proportions from it anyays,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:56:03,Yuya,not accuracy,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:55:58,Yuya,Yeah its more of a count based matrix,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:55:43,Tomoki Takasawa,Corresponding to each condition?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:55:33,Yuya,I think by doing that we can better organize our work and think about what we need to finish as well on the training front,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:55:30,Tomoki Takasawa,"Um, the number of the matrix number of instances??",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:55:10,Yuya,We should study this carefully and see if we can model our paper after these two works,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:54:39,Yuya,They just probably fit the model to the data and just reported the scores derived from those models,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:54:01,Tomoki Takasawa,Interesting. ,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:53:55,Yuya,but its not necessarily evaluated using the sort of train-test like approach,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:53:38,Yuya,which indicates that they are basing it on some accuracy metric,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:53:27,Yuya,They do have a confusion matrix,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:53:19,Yuya,,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:52:48,Yuya,The method they used the models is a bit unorthodox compared to how they use it in the ML way,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:52:27,Yuya,"Yeah, they didn't really report scores for accuracy per say",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:51:44,Tomoki Takasawa,I see. I’m a bit confused what kinda metric the second paper is using.,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:50:56,Yuya,We can borrow alot of the background formulation and such from the first paper and then use the structure and analysis from the second paper as well,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:49:46,Yuya,They used a random foreset based algorithm,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:49:32,Yuya,Which is a work that someone did very similar to what we are doing but on the previous data release set,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:49:11,Yuya,And I also found this: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KSCI-19091-001.pdf,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:48:48,Yuya,The relevant sections start from page 10,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:48:46,Tomoki Takasawa,I guess we can do something similar],0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:48:33,Tomoki Takasawa,"But yeah, the overall structure looks so organized",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:48:15,Tomoki Takasawa,This paper is quite long! lol,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:41:33,Yuya,The structure of it is very good and also clarifies alot of the work we have been doin,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:41:15,Yuya,Shared a document: https://s.groupme.com/19RlGT3,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:41:10,Yuya,You should take a look at this paper,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:30:55,Yuya,Ok,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:30:39,Tomoki Takasawa,Let me know when you share with me. I’ll just work from class,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:23:18,Tomoki Takasawa,Thx,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:22:58,Yuya,Yeah I'll share all of those docs with you,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:22:43,Tomoki Takasawa,Overleaf?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:22:31,Tomoki Takasawa,Where are you writing the final paper?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:13:47,Yuya,Same computer lab as always,1
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:13:39,Tomoki Takasawa,Where in the library are you at?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:13:28,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok. ,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:13:14,Yuya,Thats sort of the plan for toda,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:13:00,Yuya,"I think today will be mostly be working on the final paper (then figuring out what the interesting bits are from the paper and putting that in the slide deck), and running a few more models and finalizing the second phase",0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:12:17,Yuya,Do whatever you gotta do,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:11:57,Yuya,No worries,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:11:53,Tomoki Takasawa,As in leave at 3 and come back at 4,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:11:41,Tomoki Takasawa,I probably come earlier. But I need to leave 3-4 for doctors appointment,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:01:30,Yuya,You comming after class?,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:00:34,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-04-19 13:00:12,Tomoki Takasawa,Are you at the library already?,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:30:39,Tomoki Takasawa,"yes, thats the only hope lol",1
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:30:26,Yuya,It will all be over soon,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:30:10,Tomoki Takasawa,);,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:30:01,Tomoki Takasawa,"I have similar situation as well. 3 proj, 1 case study, 1 exam, 1 big hw + final report all in one week next week0",0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:26:14,Yuya,+ other stuff thats tumbling down,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:26:05,Yuya,literally 3 projects running concurrently + 1 stat exam,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:25:51,Yuya,"Yeah, i've been getting sharp migranes thinking about how much work we have left",0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:25:29,Tomoki Takasawa,Yup! Hope so too. Looking quite bad for me. lol,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:25:02,Yuya,We're at the last stretch now,1
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:24:53,Yuya,"This next few weeks is gonna be hell, but I'm sure we can both crush it",0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:24:37,Tomoki Takasawa,Sounds good.,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:24:05,Yuya,"Next week, we will work on STAT 380",0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:23:57,Yuya,We should also start work on the draft as well,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:23:43,Yuya,The presentation should be fairly easy since we only have 10 mins so the content needs to be dense and to the point,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:23:23,Yuya,Daniel also sent us some interesting references that is highly relevant to our work so we can make use of that to confirm/deny some of the findings,1
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:22:51,Yuya,We need to run a couple of more models and do some more analysis - just need to recrank the previous process and synthesize our results,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:22:23,Yuya,Since that comes up first before 380,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:22:17,Yuya,"I think rather than working on STAT 380, we should probably prioritize working on the final project presentation for DS 440",1
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:14:07,Yuya,Friday works for me,0
DS 440,2019-04-17 10:06:09,Tomoki Takasawa,"If neither days work, Ill be available on weekend too( though I assume we might wanna focus on 440 over weekend)",0

DS 440,2019-04-16 17:00:46,Tomoki Takasawa,"Oh cool! Let me get back to you on that though. My friend and I were talking about having dinner at that night. Let me check if we are still doing that. Otherwise, I’d love to! ",0
DS 440,2019-04-16 16:07:02,Yuya,Were planning around 6 pm.. does that work with your exam?,0
DS 440,2019-04-16 16:06:03,Yuya,Speaking of which do you want to grab dinner before we start working.... my friend needs to spend her meal points and we need a bunch of people to feed lol,0
DS 440,2019-04-16 16:05:27,Yuya,We said Thursday ,0
DS 440,2019-04-16 13:55:27,Tomoki Takasawa,Did we say we would meet today if Thursday?,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 10:47:39,Tomoki Takasawa,"So, STAT class is cancelled now, do you wanna give it a start on our Kaggle Project in the class time today?",0
DS 440,2019-04-15 02:02:37,Yuya,I'll resume work on my end tomorrow and we can reconvine to see what we can do,0

DS 440,2019-04-15 01:59:00,Yuya,That's been on the backburner for a while,1
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:58:34,Yuya,Also we need to work on STAT 380 project this week,1
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:58:28,Yuya,We gotta start stiching everything together,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:58:23,Yuya,The real deal presentation -,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:58:04,Yuya,Next is the final deal,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:58:00,Yuya,Well this is the last weekly report that we have to do anywayss,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:56:42,Yuya,But the distribution seems to be fixed,1
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:54:33,Tomoki Takasawa,they grade everyone the same anyways,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:54:21,Tomoki Takasawa,no they dont,0

DS 440,2019-04-15 01:52:09,Yuya,No worries,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:51:53,Tomoki Takasawa,"Ok, because of the reason above, I could not write so much to connect what I did this week to answer the insightful questions, so I could not write so much, but I am done with my part.",0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:35:40,Yuya,"Ahhh I see, gotcha",0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:34:29,Tomoki Takasawa,I misunderstood this instance part..,0

DS 440,2019-04-15 01:24:05,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok. I’m still writing mine. It’s a bit confusing to understand this anchor paper. The result that came up is not something I was expecting.,0
DS 440,2019-04-15 01:16:45,Yuya,I just finished my part,0

DS 440,2019-02-18 14:06:25,Yuya,"the orientation of the CCD panels - so this is probably the grouping with the smallest bin, but essentially the way it works is that we can characterize from which panel type did the data came from.",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 14:05:37,Yuya,Also found another interesting feature we can use,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:51:15,Yuya,Haha ok,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:51:03,Tomoki Takasawa,I was working on an assignment so not 100% sure,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:50:48,Tomoki Takasawa,No,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:50:34,Yuya,Any announcements?,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:50:27,Yuya,Not 380 tho lol,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:50:24,Yuya,yeah,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:50:17,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok we can figure things out today. U coming to class?,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:49:52,Yuya,There are a bunch of things we need to do before the wed deadline - which is mostly feature engineering work,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:48:57,Yuya,Let's spend some time today to figure out binning heuristics,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:48:38,Yuya,,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:48:35,Yuya,"So if you look at the EDA, the min and max matches the corresponding maps that we have in the image above",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:47:13,Yuya,"I just need to figure out what the sky group really represents in the data, how the satelite data is oriented - if there is some other manual we can read corresponding to the kepler telescope configuration, or ask dr ford on what the heuristics for the channels are",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:46:11,Yuya,like the pool operation to average out the data,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:46:00,Yuya,its kina like doing convolution,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:45:48,Tomoki Takasawa,I see,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:45:37,Yuya,"If we change the representation, it might make it easier for the model to pick the feature up",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:45:36,Tomoki Takasawa,"Um. That just a relative positioning of the objects, right? How does that affect? ",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:45:21,Yuya,Its not useful because of the representation,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:44:49,Tomoki Takasawa,I’m not 100% sure if sky group is really affecting the result at all though. ,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:44:48,Yuya,"The thing is sky group seems to be very useful information, but what I notice is that its not considered so important because its a) so sparse, and b) too many features",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:44:25,Tomoki Takasawa,Right. ,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:44:16,Tomoki Takasawa,I see it worth trying,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:44:11,Yuya,Though I would have to make sure the sky group actually corresponds to the values we are seeing,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:44:10,Tomoki Takasawa,Oh yeah that makes sense,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:42:47,Yuya,we bin those values together as one value,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:42:33,Yuya,"So like group by corner means, for example, see the small numbers in the top left thats like 2, 5, 19, 24",0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:42:31,Tomoki Takasawa,But did I understand your proposal correctly? ,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:41:47,Yuya,We can try both,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:41:24,Tomoki Takasawa,You mean instead of grouping by the group but rather group by the position within the each panels?,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:40:08,Yuya,Like group by center or group by corner,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:39:13,Yuya,or if we can find some clever way to encode the binnings together,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:38:58,Yuya,What we can do is group the channels (the numbers in the corner) and group them together,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:37:57,Yuya,,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:37:53,Yuya,So I found the corresponding groupping maps of the CCD sensors,0
DS 440,2019-02-18 13:37:18,Yuya,"Yo dude, I just figured out something really clever on how we can do feature engineering on the sky group",0
DS 440,2019-02-15 23:54:21,Tomoki Takasawa,Sounds good! ,0
DS 440,2019-02-15 22:02:04,Yuya,"Anyways, we will be working on more feature engineering and ensembling this week",0

DS 440,2019-02-14 22:29:53,Yuya,I can just run the equaltions over the dataset and run another feature importance metric,0
DS 440,2019-02-14 22:29:38,Yuya,Oh that I can take care of,0
DS 440,2019-02-14 22:29:30,Tomoki Takasawa,And process part?,0

DS 440,2019-02-14 22:25:01,Tomoki Takasawa,"As of now, with the feature we have, because we don’t have any of “actual” data (as opposed to ratio etc.), I don’t think we can infer anything. ",0

DS 440,2019-02-14 20:01:24,Yuya,We can use this with the feature importance tool and see if we can boost our performance,0

DS 440,2019-02-14 00:06:44,Tomoki Takasawa,Ah. right..,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 23:51:31,Yuya,"Some of the times are in days, years, seconds... so we need to find some way to normalize them. Also, remember the representation cannot be too large or else we'll end up with NaN and Infinity values",0

DS 440,2019-02-13 23:34:31,Yuya,But otherwise I think it looks good,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 23:34:14,Yuya,We gotta fix that,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 23:33:43,Yuya,"Okay, I guess this seems to work - ROC seems a bit misleading tho",0

DS 440,2019-02-13 23:32:56,Tomoki Takasawa,This is the code I used,0

DS 440,2019-02-13 23:18:38,Yuya,Looks like we can definitely do away with PCA,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 23:07:17,Yuya,That was the highest jump in performance,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 23:07:03,Yuya,Interesting... Naive Bayes Bernoulli improved 0.03 without PCA,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:21:40,Yuya,Gotcha,0

DS 440,2019-02-13 22:13:41,Yuya,So its barely anything,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:13:34,Yuya,The difference is by several thousandths to ten thousandths,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:12:43,Yuya,I'm still checking them... but so far none. The difference is probably negligible,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:12:00,Tomoki Takasawa,Did any of them cross over to .9 range?,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:11:37,Yuya,I'll have those benchmarks in by tonight,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:11:19,Yuya,I'm running the models without the PCA components - it actually does better with it by like 0.01,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 22:09:41,Yuya,This is combining that file I showed you earlier + the robovetter FLTI data,0

DS 440,2019-02-13 21:51:50,Yuya,"If we combine all of the datasets together, we have around 150 features - but I don't know which one is good to use or not... which means that if we are gonna do a feature importance metrics - we definitely need to use a spark cluster.",0

DS 440,2019-02-13 12:51:41,Yuya,Hmm,0
DS 440,2019-02-13 12:51:10,Tomoki Takasawa,I started doubting if this is actually just a Gamma CDF,0

DS 440,2019-02-06 15:34:59,Yuya,For the entire thing in general - ill explain in person,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 15:34:42,Tomoki Takasawa,For problem 1 or 2? Both?,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 15:34:34,Tomoki Takasawa,Oh really?!,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 15:26:17,Yuya,Yen clarified the problem description - actually its very different from what most of us thought,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 15:25:42,Yuya,I just got the full detailed run down of the project desc feedback,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 15:25:31,Yuya,"Yeah, prob not today.",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 14:41:16,Tomoki Takasawa,"So, does it not work today?",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 14:07:59,Yuya,I have a call today at around 6,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 14:00:52,Tomoki Takasawa,"I can meet you 4-530 and 730 and after today, if that works?",0

DS 440,2019-02-06 12:59:05,Tomoki Takasawa,Yes. For sure,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:58:44,Yuya,Thinking of maybe explaining how we're gonna proceed with this and also giving you a bit of context of how we would tackle the modeling strategy,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:58:00,Yuya,You have time today after class?,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:57:36,Tomoki Takasawa,Gotcha,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:57:36,Yuya,Prob not 380 tho,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:57:33,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:57:30,Tomoki Takasawa,"You’ll be in class today, yeah?",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:57:28,Yuya,"lol, though the hardest part is actually implementing the model and actually runnining it",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:56:51,Tomoki Takasawa,Huh. Already have pipeline for it?! Guess my weekly schedule would be somewhat off. ,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:48:06,Yuya,So far everything up to the data preprocessing pipeline is done. We can add as much data preprocessing routines as we want to - although maybe we might want to consisder doing it offline before the prediction - so generating features and what not using a cluster process or something.,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:43:55,Yuya,"when I was running some models, it told me that there were non-binary labels and saw that there were some 2s mixed in",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:43:24,Yuya,lol you would have to dig in the data to actually see that,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:43:04,Tomoki Takasawa,"Um, didn’t notice value 2 in data set!",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:42:07,Tomoki Takasawa,"Yeah, I’m reading as I text",0

DS 440,2019-02-06 12:41:28,Tomoki Takasawa,But yeah now I see haha,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:41:23,Tomoki Takasawa,I haven’t checked it today yet,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:40:45,Yuya,Also you saw my email this morning right? the one I cc'd u in,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:39:45,Yuya,esp when the last page already docks off with the whole project schedule tho...,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:39:12,Yuya,I mean tbh its kina hard to write alot of detaills in just 4 pages 12 pt font tho,0

DS 440,2019-02-06 12:38:18,Yuya,looks like they were pretty strict with grading it this time - the highest that anyone could get this time was 7.5,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 12:37:29,Yuya,lol so it seems like we got our grade back from the paper,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:50:20,Tomoki Takasawa,I see,0

DS 440,2019-02-06 00:19:38,Tomoki Takasawa,"Nope, I guess. DS 300 for privacy and security instead",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:49,Yuya,No machine learning!?,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:45,Yuya,Wtf,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:41,Yuya,That was machine learning,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:40,Tomoki Takasawa,yea,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:38,Tomoki Takasawa,"I could be wrong tho, but not required for DS anymore \",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:31,Yuya,Jeez they keep on changing the curriculum,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:17:07,Tomoki Takasawa,"Um, I dont think that class is offered anymore",0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:16:56,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:16:52,Tomoki Takasawa,DS 310??,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:16:43,Yuya,Yeah this was for 310,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:16:38,Tomoki Takasawa,You made it for other project?,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:16:22,Tomoki Takasawa,That's kinda cool,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:14:15,Yuya,https://github.com/yutarochan/clickbait/blob/master/Development/baseline/baseline_model/baseline_model_score-report.md,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:14:15,Yuya,Also our model pipeline can generate nice classification metrics reports like theses:,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:10:27,Yuya,atom editor,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:10:17,Tomoki Takasawa,What ide do you use?,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:09:47,Tomoki Takasawa,Btw,0
DS 440,2019-02-06 00:09:44,Tomoki Takasawa,Oh awesome! You really made a good jump start!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 23:49:15,Yuya,Update: Finished most of the data loader + preprocessing pipeline,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:48:33,Yuya,Thanks!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:48:28,Tomoki Takasawa,I will be taking look at the baseline model soon!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:48:13,Tomoki Takasawa,Cool,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:47:29,Yuya,Once I code this up - then we can scale our training methods to as many models we want and exponentially automate our entire process,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:47:03,Yuya,I'm working on getting a pipeline up and running - so far I got configuration file parsers and other functions up and runing,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:46:31,Yuya,It would be great if you can start to document and explain some of the process,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:46:29,Tomoki Takasawa,ok!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:46:15,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:46:09,Tomoki Takasawa,"Should I also take a look at his repo, right?",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 22:45:56,Tomoki Takasawa,"Ok, I see. If you think it's worth it, I'm not against it.",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:51:05,Yuya,"I also want to spend some time to look at this repo that I found which uses the same datasets we use in our work.
This guy actually has some pretty useful features and scripts that we can potentially exploit.
https://github.com/dfm/dr25

Though his work is a bit cryptic so we need to go in there and annotate alot of things too and cross match it against some of the literature.",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:50:20,Yuya,"If we do end up getting the same parameters, then maybe its not that effective - but I think it might be worth looking into. We might even use this baseline as part of an ensemble depending on how the analysis goes",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:49:12,Yuya,"Implementing it shouldn't take too long and it would just be a matter of pipelining the a, b, and c coefficients through an optimizer routine.",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:47:42,Tomoki Takasawa,"For parameter tuning, I’m not so sure. If it’s not make a big difference, I feel like we can postpone for later? I’m not sure tho",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:46:50,Yuya,Thanks,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:46:19,Tomoki Takasawa,"For the baseline model bit, for sure I’ll fame a look. ",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:41:29,Yuya,"Also, if you have time, do you think you can look into the implementation of the baseline model.
For now, I'm using this: 0.94 * stats.gamma.cdf(exp_mes, 30.87, scale=0.271), but I just want to make sure that I implemented it correctly.

Also, I was thinking what if we try to solve for the parameters of this model on our own (although it wont make too much of a difference, but I think its worth trying) - maybe using a hyperparameter tuning algo as a try. What do you think?",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:38:58,Tomoki Takasawa,Yeah that sounds good. Please do. ,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:37:07,Yuya,So far I got 1 and 4 down - still need to figure out how too organize and process 2 and 3,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:32:30,Yuya,I already got a pretty decent pipeline going and I'll explain everything tomorrow in class.,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 20:31:59,Yuya,I'm gonna try to write out the entire training pipeline so that we can start to focus on modeling and building as many models iteratively.,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 12:20:48,Yuya,"Sure, we can discuss tomorrow.",1
DS 440,2019-02-05 12:20:19,Tomoki Takasawa,"I see. We can discuss how to divide up the task tomorrow! If you can show me the pipeline visually, I can probably do 1.",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 11:41:30,Yuya,"The default model is actually pretty terrible, F1 is around 0.6",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 11:41:17,Yuya,"So far I've finished implementing the baseline model and xgb - both are pretty hacky right now wrt to how the modeling pipeline works, so we gotta build up the structure.",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 11:01:12,Yuya,"We need to find some way to streamline the model building process so that we can do the following:
1. Modularize each model component into some abstract interface
2. Be able to perform hyperparameter tuning operations
3. Perform cross-validation methods
4. Record any loss, accuracy, and other metrics in a readable and organized fashion",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:54:01,Tomoki Takasawa,Thanks!!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:53:35,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok will check all out! ,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:44:00,Yuya,The source code should be pretty self explanatory as for which algorithm corresponds to what,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:43:44,Yuya,So you can also take a look at how each analysis did comparatively,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:43:31,Yuya,I'll upload the feature importance results on the Google Drive,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:41:59,Tomoki Takasawa,I'm checking it out today!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:41:53,Tomoki Takasawa,Gotcha,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:34:53,Yuya,The whole feature importance script actually took around an hour to run on my machine,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 10:34:22,Yuya,Yeah its up on Github,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 09:08:43,Tomoki Takasawa,Haha that was quick. Let me check it out! Is it on github?,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 07:05:45,Yuya,"As expected the analysis definitely shows that Expected MES is important, which confirms our beliefs on the features to use.",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 07:05:17,Yuya,"Figured it out - I came across a useful library that can help address this issue... so here is the list of features that I came up with ranked by my algorithm. Note I've also used PCA values as well in addition to the original features.

{'Expected_MES': 1, 'pca2': 2, 'i_dur': 3, 'pca4': 4, 'i_period': 5, 'N_Transit': 6, 'i_dor': 7, 'pca8': 8, 'pca10': 9, 'pca9': 10, 'pca7': 11, 'i_depth': 12, 'pca3': 13, 'i_epoch': 14, 'pca1': 15, 'i_ror': 16, 'pca6': 17, 'pca5': 18, 'i_b': 19, 'Sky_Group': 20}",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 06:29:15,Yuya,So far I have a list of different ranks of various features and their scores - we need to come up with some systematic way to aggregate and collect each of the rankings as a single list thru aggregation.,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 06:14:25,Yuya,Update: Finished the base feature importance analysis tool,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:43:04,Yuya,Okay,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:42:02,Tomoki Takasawa,Oh ok. That works,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:41:54,Tomoki Takasawa,I think part of the class time for Wed will be for this project ,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:41:51,Yuya,Like how to structure the code so that our workflow is efficient,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:41:27,Yuya,"Not really, it's more like code org",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:41:19,Tomoki Takasawa,Sounds good to me!,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:41:10,Tomoki Takasawa,"When you say organize, you mean like task management platform??",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:41:00,Yuya,Let's actually find a time to meetup and discuss how we will tackle this so that you can help me with some of the modeling,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:40:34,Yuya,I'm gonna be using python for all of this tho,0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:40:20,Tomoki Takasawa,"Yes, we can do that. Do you have any preferred platform?",0
DS 440,2019-02-05 01:40:01,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok. ,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 23:56:21,Yuya,We prob need to find a way to organize the code though,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 23:56:07,Yuya,Haha yeah I'll do so soon.,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 23:20:26,Tomoki Takasawa,I want to check it out so I won’t fall too behind ,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 23:10:32,Tomoki Takasawa,Did you push all to github?,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 23:10:14,Tomoki Takasawa,Bruh that’s awesome!!,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 19:50:29,Yuya,So I already threw an xgb model at it and it's already achieving a 83% test accuracy with 10 cv,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 18:37:49,Yuya,The task now is trying to build a much more efficient pipeline for the modeling,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 18:37:18,Tomoki Takasawa,Thx!,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 18:37:09,Yuya,Np,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 18:36:55,Tomoki Takasawa,"I cannot be back to work till later tonight. However, if you would still be working around 11, let me know if I can do anything for it.",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 17:52:25,Yuya,I'm gonna start work on the modeling pipeline,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:20:12,Tomoki Takasawa,haha,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:20:01,Yuya,lol,0

DS 440,2019-02-04 15:19:53,Yuya,Just submitted it,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:19:45,Tomoki Takasawa,Cool,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:19:26,Yuya,Yeah it says in canvas that it will be for both of us,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:19:12,Yuya,I think as long as one person submits its fine,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:18:48,Tomoki Takasawa,lol Are we both submitting?,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:18:38,Yuya,Thats my typical paper writing style,0

DS 440,2019-02-04 15:05:24,Tomoki Takasawa,I would like to do that. Yes.,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:04:57,Yuya,Any last min checks?,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:04:51,Yuya,Cool - I'm about to submit the paper now tho,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:04:31,Tomoki Takasawa,"Yeah, other than that, we were given time to work on the paper due tonight.",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:04:16,Yuya,I'm also gonna start writing out the modeling pipeline tonight,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:04:05,Yuya,Ah gotcha - I think he uploaded the slides on canvas so I can take a look i guess,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:03:34,Tomoki Takasawa,"Just a recommendation, it's optional",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:03:24,Tomoki Takasawa,No,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:03:19,Tomoki Takasawa,"Also, he talked about the importance of analyzing the detailed information (input, output, environmental conditions) when the deliverable fails.",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:02:18,Yuya,or just a suggestion for what we should do?,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:02:07,Yuya,"Ah, do we need to use that?",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:01:46,Tomoki Takasawa,"Btw, in class, we talked about the task management tool called Wrike",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:01:40,Yuya,Formatting issues,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:01:29,Yuya,Uhh... not on my screen tho...,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 15:01:02,Tomoki Takasawa,Is there a reason for a blank 4th page??,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 14:59:33,Yuya,"Alright, just finished the paper",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 14:17:54,Yuya,"thx lol, I'll text you before I fire off with the proposal for a single last check of the content",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 14:17:01,Tomoki Takasawa,"And of course, will let you know about the class",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 14:16:50,Tomoki Takasawa,Yes I saw it on the drive as you were writing! Lol,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 14:16:10,Yuya,"Yo, I'm not gonna show up to class so keep me in the loop of whats going on in class.
Also, I'm almost done with the paper so lmk if there is something you want to change, add/delete.
I'm gonna submit it once I finish through with the last sections",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:51:04,Tomoki Takasawa,Sounds good thx,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:56,Yuya,I can always add on,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:52,Yuya,"Dont worry, just try your best to fill in the table",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:46,Tomoki Takasawa,Ooh,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:38,Yuya,"(i.e. ROC Curves, accuracy, etc)",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:37,Tomoki Takasawa,Um gotcha,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:24,Yuya,Yeah - and results of the model,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:13,Tomoki Takasawa,Will it be classifier itself?,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:50:03,Tomoki Takasawa,"When you say deliverable, what will deliverable for TPS Classifer?",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:44:07,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:43:55,Tomoki Takasawa,"For Project Plan, yeah?",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:43:25,Yuya,"I know working with Yen, he would want something specific.",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:43:11,Yuya,Looks roughly okay - its probably best to be specific on the type of expected deliverable that we would provide.,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:42:19,Tomoki Takasawa,I just drafted a rough one for last 2 sections. Can you verify if it is roughly ok?,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:14:50,Tomoki Takasawa,Um,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:14:26,Yuya,So we prob should get rolling,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:14:22,Yuya,Prob not,0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:13:49,Tomoki Takasawa,"well, the class ends at 345, so shouldn't it be enough?",0
DS 440,2019-02-04 00:13:30,Tomoki Takasawa,"Oh, shoot",0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:55:25,Yuya,Wait but isn't the thing due at 5 PM tho,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:51:54,Yuya,Probably ,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:51:14,Tomoki Takasawa,Awesome! You coming to stat 380?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:51:00,Yuya,Sounds good,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:50:55,Tomoki Takasawa,How's that sound?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:50:51,Tomoki Takasawa,"After that, I can write those parts based on that.",0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:50:39,Tomoki Takasawa,"Yes. I can do that part then. Let's talk briefly tomorrow, so I will have more clear ideas though.",0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:50:15,Yuya,"Just as long as we have things like eda, modeling, etc itll be fine",0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:50:00,Yuya,The outline can be preliminary so it doesnt have to be exact,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:49:45,Yuya,Do you wanna work on that?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:49:25,Tomoki Takasawa,Last 2 sections require us to list all things needed to do weekly as well as the milestones. Do you have anything in mind at this point?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:46:40,Yuya,"Yeah we can do that too, for finishing touches and such",0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:46:25,Tomoki Takasawa,Shall we get together sometimes tomorrow and finish it?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:46:14,Yuya,Anything you know you can cover. ,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:46:05,Yuya,See if you can fill in the remaining sections,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:45:53,Yuya,Still getting some of my materials now ,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:45:52,Tomoki Takasawa,Is there anything I can do?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:45:34,Tomoki Takasawa,How's the paper going?,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:44:45,Yuya,Nice,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:44:34,Tomoki Takasawa,I am done too,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:24:55,Yuya,Now I'm gonna start working on the paper.,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:24:47,Yuya,"Phew, I finished the project in time. Haha",0
DS 440,2019-02-03 23:24:37,Yuya,Ahh,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 19:58:05,Tomoki Takasawa,Hope I’ll make it on time..,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 19:57:55,Tomoki Takasawa,Not yet. Lol ,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 18:53:05,Yuya,I'll get to the proposal once I finish the 380 project,0
DS 440,2019-02-03 18:52:45,Yuya,U finished the mini project yet?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:57:59,Tomoki Takasawa,Lady ,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:57:57,Tomoki Takasawa,Italian last,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:34:11,Yuya,Who do you have?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:12:29,Tomoki Takasawa,"I think she will be easy too, she just assigns some homework and reading, but it's not difficult",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:03:01,Yuya,Zhang was so easy,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:56,Yuya,lol,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:44,Tomoki Takasawa,lol,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:42,Tomoki Takasawa,Npe,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:38,Yuya,Ahh,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:36,Yuya,Hmm I thought he was teaching it,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:28,Tomoki Takasawa,"That sounds like a guy's name, but it'a lady",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:22,Yuya,Zhang?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:02:14,Tomoki Takasawa,I do not think so?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:01:17,Yuya,Luke teaching that class still?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:01:06,Yuya,Gotcha,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 17:00:40,Tomoki Takasawa,"I'll need to do DS 300 mini proj due tonight, but should have time later tonight",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:54:24,Yuya,"Anyways let's get this done as soon as possible tho, dont want to drag it on]",1
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:42:28,Yuya,Sweet the due date moved,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:27:23,Yuya,"See if you can also fill in the other sections, I'll alsoo work my way through each of them tooo",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:23:43,Tomoki Takasawa,What else can I do for the proposal?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:23:33,Tomoki Takasawa,"Ok, that sounds good.",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:14:50,Yuya,Dont worry I'll formulate the description,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:12:50,Yuya,"This seems like dynamic model with constant improvement, right? How can we keep feeding the data? We only have finite amount or 'real' data.
Yes, the real data is used to train on the discriminator - and essentially we feed the data thru noise - so like creating something out of almost nothing. Basically the generator is trying to learn the distribution of the learned discriminator",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:05:46,Yuya,,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:05:43,Yuya,"How do you fake the feature to make it close to the real one?
Essentially, the model is trying to optimize a min-max type of formula, and in the end should generate good images if it converges",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:04:21,Yuya,"> Are we training it separately, I assume?
Yes, so basically training goes like 1) train discriminator 2) Then randomly feed noise and get output from generator 3) feed that into discriminator 4) compute loss wrt the generator and the discriminator and backprop",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:02:22,Tomoki Takasawa,"Oh, srry. Keep going",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:02:08,Yuya,So to answer your questions...,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:02:06,Tomoki Takasawa,I just jut down my understanding on the shred docs. Plz feel free to make a correction,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:01:45,Yuya,"On the other hand, the discriminator is trying its best to detect whether its fake or real",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 16:00:45,Yuya,So the goal of the generator is to make the discriminator think that the output it produced is the real data as much as possible - so you can imagine the loss function containing the discriminator as a function of the input,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:59:43,Yuya,"Then once we do that, we can train the generator, which works by taking some random input (like some noise distribution) and feeding it in the generative model which will produce an output that we can then feed into the discriminator",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:58:08,Yuya,Basically the idea is to first train the discriminator with the real data set,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:57:51,Yuya,So the generator we actually train jointly with the discriminator,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:18:30,Tomoki Takasawa,"This seems like dynamic model with constant improvement, right? How can we keep feeding the data? We only have finite amount or 'real' data.",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:16:19,Tomoki Takasawa,"I've gotten a few questions that I'm not sure, but I see how it works theoretically.",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:15:00,Tomoki Takasawa,"Also, is amount of data enough?",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:14:39,Tomoki Takasawa,How do you fake the feature to make it close to the real one?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:11:52,Tomoki Takasawa,but how?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:11:01,Tomoki Takasawa,"Are we training it separately, I assume?",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:10:51,Tomoki Takasawa,I am not 100 % sure how we would do the generator part.,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:10:19,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:10:13,Tomoki Takasawa,You're talking about approach of using GAN model for prediction?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:09:33,Yuya,Today is early dismissal and tomorrow is closed ,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:09:11,Tomoki Takasawa,Tomorrow?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:09:06,Yuya,So what do you think about the approach?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:08:43,Yuya,And tomorrow,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:08:40,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:08:37,Tomoki Takasawa,Today?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:08:19,Yuya,Lol early dismissal and class canceled ,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:08:18,Tomoki Takasawa,I am done with both links you sent me! Interesting approach,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 15:08:03,Tomoki Takasawa,Sounds good,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 14:01:05,Yuya,Yup,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 13:41:25,Tomoki Takasawa,"OK. So, you won't come to class, correct?",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 12:03:24,Yuya,"Not really, I think the prompt is pretty straight forward so I'll be continuing to write it",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 12:02:55,Tomoki Takasawa,Do you have any questions to professor? Or would like to get feedback?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 12:02:38,Tomoki Takasawa,"It’s up to you. We are in the same room for STAT 380, so we can decide then ",0
DS 440,2019-01-30 11:42:02,Yuya,My meeting got cancelled today,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 11:41:53,Yuya,R u comming to class?,0
DS 440,2019-01-30 00:07:35,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:29:26,Yuya,"Yup, I will keep working on it tonight so that we can have the majority of it done and maybe do some more brain storming and editing tomorrow in class",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:28:51,Tomoki Takasawa,Sounds good. I will need to read upon those papers beforehand. But it all sounds good,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:27:23,Yuya,We'll think about it more once we write out the problem description,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:26:34,Yuya,We can maybe try using the raw pixel image of the data,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:26:10,Yuya,Then afterwards train the generator jointly with the discriminator network,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:25:55,Yuya,We first train the discriminative models against the real dataset,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:25:41,Yuya,and a generator network - which essentially creates synthetic data (similar to the injection models),0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:25:17,Yuya,So you have the discriminator network - which essentially can be our model for deciding whether the input data is a planet or non planet,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:24:57,Yuya,,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:24:54,Yuya,Basically the model looks like this:,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:24:45,Tomoki Takasawa,That sounds super exciting!,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:23:51,Yuya,I think we can come up with a very unique approach to this problem if we can formulate the model in the right wqay,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 23:21:58,Yuya,I think it would be a very interesting approach - though I will still need to figure the details out more carefully,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 23:19:46,Tomoki Takasawa,Ok,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:19:39,Yuya,Though I will probably go anyways because I have a meeting tomorrow at the IST,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:19:36,Tomoki Takasawa,It might even get cancelled,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 23:19:29,Tomoki Takasawa,true,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 23:17:25,Tomoki Takasawa,I was done on section 2.,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 19:12:48,Yuya,lol prob not a good idea to print it... its a lot of paper,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:12:28,Yuya,Or actually this one has a much clearer statement regarding the impact: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WGqT9FMk0WggbdR-GZmIu6ITuQVxBlT/view?usp=sharing,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 19:11:07,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:10:18,Tomoki Takasawa,gotcha,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:10:16,Tomoki Takasawa,oh,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:10:14,Tomoki Takasawa,It just opened up a folder in Foofle doc,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:10:10,Yuya,See the first PDF file called: Kepler: A Search for Terrestrial Planets,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:09:20,Yuya,There are more details in that link I sent above,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:09:13,Yuya,Yeah,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:07:41,Tomoki Takasawa,"That's pretty much half of section 2, right? We need to elaborate a bit, but that's the significance of this project",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:05:50,Yuya,"So the end goal is towards predicting planets - which would greatly allow us to efficiently narrow down the planet of interests so that researchers can study a small number of planets, rather than looking at thousands of planets",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:04:58,Yuya,part 2 is actually building the model to predict whether the TCE is a planet or a non planet and its type if its not.,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:03:51,Yuya,"Basically, part 1 is understanding how likely the PLTI is able to recover signals from the search pipeline from the injection parameters.",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:03:09,Yuya,I have to rewrite part 1 again because I need to make certain parts explicit,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:02:54,Yuya,Just the whole pipeline in general,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:02:46,Tomoki Takasawa,or just the second part?,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:02:40,Yuya,"You can find stuff on that from here, which has some details on the implication:

DS 440,2019-01-29 19:02:34,Tomoki Takasawa,"I see. I suppose that's for both the classification model for problem 1 and the model we come up with for the second part of the problem, yeah?",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:00:27,Yuya,"Essentially its like, say we have the model, how is this gonna help the client or what impact do we make",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 19:00:07,Yuya,Yeah its what I said above,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:58:05,Yuya,"Hold on, let me read the instructions",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:57:53,Yuya,The second section is more or less what the implication of the modeling process will yield,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:57:17,Tomoki Takasawa,"I am reading the problem description on canvas now. Do you think some of the stuff you have in introduction can go to the second section? You basically were talking about the expectation of the project, and second section is about that, I believe..",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:53:46,Yuya,Nice nice,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:48:16,Tomoki Takasawa,"Also, took a look at the notebook in github",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:48:08,Yuya,Ah nice,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:47:59,Tomoki Takasawa,"Also, finished reading through the firs paper",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:47:26,Tomoki Takasawa,Just got back,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 18:00:21,Yuya,lmk when you're working on the paper,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 13:25:02,Yuya,Have yet to run some feature importance metrics,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 11:48:54,Yuya,with the baseline model implemented as well,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:48:47,Yuya,"Also, I should have the entire model evaluation pipeline done by the end of the week",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:44:39,Yuya,"Cool, I'll probably be done with most of the literature by then to be able to write something sensible",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:43:28,Tomoki Takasawa,"Ok. I will have class till around 6 today, but I will do what I can do from there.",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:42:21,Yuya,I just wrote something for now - but I think I might have to do a rewrite to make things much more concrete,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:41:18,Yuya,lol,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:41:15,Tomoki Takasawa,"Haha I know. I was hoping to receive an email before today's class, but not seen it yet...",0

DS 440,2019-01-29 11:40:32,Yuya,"But given the weather, maybe class might be cancelled lol (hopefully)",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:39:29,Yuya,Then we can use the time there to fix anything thats necessary,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:39:15,Yuya,I'll probably still go so I can get some preliminary feedback,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 11:37:59,Tomoki Takasawa,Are you planning on finishing the paper by tonight and not come to the lab tomorrow?,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:48:31,Yuya,Pay attention to how they look at expected MES - we can probably derive some features from how they compute that,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:47:00,Tomoki Takasawa,That would be great help,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:46:45,Tomoki Takasawa,Oh haha ok. Will try that method ,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:46:31,Yuya,I'm gonna upload some notebooks with some prelim feature engineering process as well,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:45:57,Yuya,"Thank god I took astro 1, w/o it i would actually have no idea what this paper is talking about tho",0

DS 440,2019-01-29 10:44:36,Yuya,Just read fast enough to get the main idea of the paper,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 10:43:22,Yuya,but is useful,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:43:17,Yuya,The one before is just another basic guide for the TSEC files,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 10:43:04,Yuya,"Oops, wrong one - this is the one: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/KSCI-19109-002.pdf",0

DS 440,2019-01-29 09:27:31,Yuya,Also I found this neat repo which we can maybe use esp for feature engineering,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 09:21:33,Yuya,The first paper describes PLTI,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 09:21:04,Yuya,I need to add those docs to the drive,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 09:20:55,Yuya,The first paper makes references to some of those two methods,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 09:20:27,Tomoki Takasawa,A question. I am not familiar with injection modeling. Do you have paper about that?,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 09:12:52,Tomoki Takasawa,Gotcha. I'll familiarize myself with paper now,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 09:00:48,Yuya,"Part 1 is working on developing a classification model using the PLTI datasets.
Part 2 is using the FLTI features combined with PLTI features - it would be interesting to explore using maybe GANs to perform the injection modeling (i.e use the same PLTI classifier for the discriminator and use FLTI based features for the generator function)",0
DS 440,2019-01-29 08:56:47,Yuya,So the basic idea of the project goes something like this:,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 08:56:28,Yuya,And there is a couple of literature related to the FLTI features,0

DS 440,2019-01-29 08:42:42,Yuya,I added some materials in the drive,0
DS 440,2019-01-29 08:41:22,Yuya,Theres also a bunch of stuff u should read to familiarize yourself with the objectives and data,0

DS 440,2019-01-27 20:48:42,Tomoki Takasawa,"Yeah, it's a bit tough decision. I'm leaning towards planets, but cyber one interests me too. How about we finalize the decision tomorrow when we meet?",0
DS 440,2019-01-27 19:51:35,Yuya,"I can do either cyber or planets, but I think the planets one is much more clearly defined ",0

DS 440,2019-01-27 19:50:44,Tomoki Takasawa,So I’m leaning a bit more towards planet one. ,0
